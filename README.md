# Credit Card Application Approval Prediction  

## üìú Introduction  
The traditional process of approving credit card applications is heavily reliant on manual reviews or simplistic decision rules. These methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors, leading to suboptimal decisions. This project aims to modernize and streamline this process by developing a machine learning model capable of automating decision-making with high precision and efficiency.

By leveraging a rich dataset from Kaggle, we designed a classification system that reduces delays, enhances accuracy, and minimizes human intervention, ensuring better customer satisfaction and improved business profitability.

## üìä Datasets  
### 1. **Credit Card Data**  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Demographics: Gender, marital status, property ownership, etc.  
  - Financials: Annual income, employment duration.  
  - Lifestyle: Housing type, phone access.  

### 2. **Credit Card Labels**  
- **Key Features**:  
  - `Application Status`: Approval (0) or Rejection (1).

## üîß Preprocessing Steps  
1. **Data Merging**: Combined datasets on a common key (`ID`).  
2. **Missing Value Handling**: Used statistical imputation techniques (e.g., mode, median).  
3. **Outlier Treatment**: Applied capping (5th and 95th percentiles) for robust data.  
4. **Feature Transformation**: Converted skewed numerical features and scaled them using Min-Max scaling.  
5. **Encoding**: Applied ordinal and one-hot encoding for categorical features.
